# ZZeact - A React Clone

## Credit
This project builds from [Rodrigo Pombo](https://medium.com/@pomber)'s tutorial: [Didact: a DIY guide to build your own React](https://engineering.hexacta.com/didact-learning-how-react-works-by-building-it-from-scratch-51007984e5c5)

I added Webpack 4 and Babel 7, and refactored the project to components.
